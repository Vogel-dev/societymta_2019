RPG gamemode developed for the Multi Theft Auto platform, primarily written in Lua and utilizing a MySQL database. The gamemode was personally developed by me in 2019 and is now publicly available. You are permitted to use code snippets or the entire gamemode to create your own servers. However, please refrain from removing my attribution from the asset descriptions.

## Authors
* My role in the project was to provide comprehensive technical support, develop new solutions and scripts, and upload them to the server.
* The code includes appropriate annotations for items that were not authored by me. Some portions of the code were obtained from the community and subsequently modified.
* The maps for the server were created by: Dudek.
* Please note that the vehicle models used in the project are not original and, as a result, are not included in the package.

## Repository content
* All Lua scripts used on the server
* MySQL database structure
* Access control list file
* File responsible for the automatic execution of scripts at server startup
* Additional required modules

### Repository does not contain:

* Forum code or synchronization of the game account with the forum account
* Vehicle models

#### Support
* The gamemode is no longer supported by me.
* I do not provide assistance with its installation and connection to the database.
* I do not share models of vehicles that were present on the server.
